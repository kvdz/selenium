This program is a unit test for www.hudl.com.

In order to run this you need to manually fill in the web drivers paths and login credentials.
These has been removed because of privacy reasons.

Package needed:
- selenium, can use "pip install selenium".
- unittest is part of python.

How to run it?
    Python main.py

What to improve when more time:
- Make use of multiple browsers by using factory design pattern.
  This prevents duplicating the unit tests. I would also includes a way to run on all browsers supported by OS and specific when called.

- Improve run time, currently some sleeps where added to see the result. In automated test this is not necessary.
  Also not opening the browser and closing it on each test can reduce test time, by not using a new driver every set up of the unit test.

- Use a global variable for the website url and only add the additional paths for specific test.
  When you want to test it on another running instance of the website you could easily perform the same test on that other instance.

- Expand the unit test with more bad use cases, for example:
   - login brute forcing and other security tests.
   - page transition testing: main page to login to home page, home page to upload and do an upload.
   - and some more on the home page.

- I would use a development/local version of the website, not the live one like I did now.
  When it does crash with a test you catch it without users experience down time.
  This development/local version of the website can be used to end user test beta/new features.
  It would be a challenge for all QA'er to break it. When someone breaks it, he deserves a reward/praise.
